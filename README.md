## About
This project is based on the base code from the book SFML Game Development By Example. A basic Snake Game is discussed in Chapter 3 of the book. 

The game at the end of the chapter has basic movement, a score counter and a life counter. To make sure I understood the code in the chapter I decided to add more features. 

## Added Features
- Adjustment to apples and score given.
- Added a new speed item that gives a new score value and speeds up the snake
- Border colour changes when the player loses a life to provide a visual prompt.
- Every 5th Segment of the snake is now blue, which helps to give a slithering effect.
- Added a high score board, utilises Text File Writing.
- Added a Start and Game Over Screen, which utilises a basic Game State System.
